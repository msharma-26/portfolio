    <title>Meera Sharma: Personal Site and Portfolio</title>
    <h1>Meera Sharma</h1>
    <p>I'm a third year Molecular and Cell Biology major with a Data Science Minor at UCSD! This is my portfolio, which is in the process of being updated and built out!
        <br> I plan to apply to graduate school in the fall, to study Molecular or Quantitative Biology. 
        <br> Outside of class, I am a Supplemental Instrucion (SI) leader at the UCSD Teaching and Learning Commons, and I love reading, crocheting, and cooking!
